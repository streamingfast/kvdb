# Change log

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Removed

- [`tivk`] **BREAKING** The raw max batch put size dsn query parameter `tikv_raw_max_batch_put_size=<value>` has been removed (the `tikv-client/v2` keeps it private now).
- [`tivk`] **BREAKING** The raw batch pair count dsn query parameter `tikv_raw_batch_pair_count=<value>` has been removed (the `tikv-client/v2` keeps it private now).

### Changed

- [`tivk`] **BREAKING** Upgraded to `tikv-client/v2` version, this currently requires TiKV version 5.0.0+.
- [`tivk`] **BREAKING** The raw max scan limit dsn query parameter `tikv_raw_max_scan_limit=<value>` now applies globally to all instances. This means if in the use application, multiple DSN for TiKV are provided, the last one with `tikv_raw_max_scan_limit` wins.

### Added

- [`common`] Calling `Iterator.Err()` without ever having called `Iterator.Next()` is now an error.
- [`badger`] Added support for using `WithTruncate` option on Badger to delete not persisted data on starting by adding `truncate=true` param to DSN url (i.e. `badger:///path?truncate=true`)
- [`badger`] Added support for switching to ZSTD compression instead of Snappy by providing `compression=zstd` param to DSN url (i.e. `badger:///path?compression=zstd`)

## [v0.1.0]

### Fixed
- [`tikv`] Fixed `store.BatchDelete` not deleting keys correctly, it was not prefixing the key with the table.
- [`badger`] Fixed error propagation when dealing with `WriteBatch` transaction, only `ErrTxnTooBig` was checked, now any error is propagated.
- [`tikv`] Fixed `store.Scan` not returning more than 10561 rows.
- [`tikv`] Fixed invalid `store.ErrNotFound` being thrown when `store.WithEmptyValue` is used and the value stored is empty.
- [`tikv`] Fixed `store.WithEmptyValue` support when using compression that was not compressing the "formatted" value that should have been sent to TiKV.

### Changed
- [`core`] Now supporting key-only iteration for `BatchPrefix`, `Prefix` and `Scan` calls.
- [`core`] **BREAKING** Added `options ...store.ReadOption` options to `store.KVStore#BatchPrefix`.
- [`core`] **BREAKING** Added `options ...store.ReadOption` options to `store.KVStore#Prefix`.
- [`core`] **BREAKING** Added `options ...store.ReadOption` options to `store.KVStore#Scan`.
- [`badger`] Improved implementation of `Prefix` by reducing number of internal shards Badger is going to check when doing the prefix search.
- [`tikv`] Improved implementation of `Prefix` and `BatchPrefix` by using TiKV client raw max scan limit value to iterate.
- [`tikv`] Added ability to customize TiKV client raw max scan limit using `tikv_raw_max_scan_limit=<value>` query parameter in dsn (accepts positive numbers).
- [`tikv`] Added ability to customize TiKV client raw max batch put size using `tikv_raw_max_batch_put_size=<value>` query parameter in dsn (accepts positive numbers).
- [`tikv`] Added ability to customize TiKV client raw batch pair count using `tikv_raw_batch_pair_count=<value>` query parameter in dsn (accepts positive numbers).
- [`tikv`] Re-implemented `store.BatchGet` using native TiKV client BatchGet.
- [`tikv`] Changed batch size threshold default value to 7MiB, the idea is to reduce the chance that the batch reach this value.
- [`tikv`] Added ability to customize batch time threshold by using `batch_time_threshold=<value>` query parameter in dsn (accepts `time.Duration` string formats).
- [`tikv`] Added ability to customize batch ops threshold by using `batch_ops_threshold=<value>` query parameter in dsn (accepts positive numbers).
- [`tikv`] Added ability to customize batch size threshold by using `batch_size_threshold=<value>` query parameter in dsn (accepts positive numbers).
- [`tikv`] Added ability to customize compression size threshold by using `compression_size_threshold=<value>` query parameter in dsn (accepts positive numbers).
- [`tikv`] Re-added support for compression to overcome issue where single element are bigger than 8MB. This is now an opt-in feature, to activate, use `compression=zstd` query parameter in dsn.
- [`tikv`] Default batch size threshold is now 8MiB, which is the default max raft entry size in TiKV.
- [`core`] **BREAKING** Renamed `store.BachOp` to `store.BatchOp` (fixed typo in `Bach`).
- [`core`] Added `Close` method on `store.KVStore`.

## [v0.0.1]

### Changed
- [`core`] Added `BatchPrefix` method on `store.KVStore`. It's now possible to perform multiple prefix scan on a single batch. Driver not supporting natively the functionality degrades to a sequential call to standard prefix capabilities.
- [`core`] **BREAKING** Added `limit` options to `store.KVStore#Prefix`.
- [`core`] **BREAKING** Function `store.Iterator#Next` return's type is now `store.KV`, previously `*store.KV`.
- [`core`] **BREAKING** Function `store.Iterator#PushItem` `item` argument's type is now `store.KV`, previously `*store.KV`.
- [`tikv`] Added 'OptionEmptyValueEnable' to let the driver simulate empty values by adding a little byte to every row
- **BREAKING** Removed explicit compression (just use built-in from each db), only kept within badger for backward-compatibility

### Improved
- [`core`] Reduced memory allocations when receiving items from iterators.
- [`badger`] Improved performance of `Scan` in presence of small limit value.
- [`bigkv`] Improved performance of `BatchGet` which was sequential instead of using BigTable `ReadRows` call which is batched.

### Fixed

- [`badger`] Fixed returning proper store.NotFoundErrors on 'BatchGet'

## [pre-open-sourcing]

### Changed

* The `GetTransactionEvents` family of functions that take a transaction ID prefix, NOW REQUIRE a prefix that is an even number of hex characters (as they are converted to bytes and compared on bytes). They cannot be compared on half a byte (which a single hex character represents).  Sanitization must happen before calling this library, or those calls will panic.

* License changed to Apache 2.0
